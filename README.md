# Real README
## .... ooh, this will be a *little* bit harder
### (there's another one deeper in the directory structure)

Here I added some text that maybe does/maybe doesn't touch the hunk of a change in another branch

Testing merging impact of selective changes and issues that might ocme up with
trying to track elements of a fork while modifying others.


Look. I added stuff to the bottom of the README.
Somethign that should be easy for git diff to effectively track.
